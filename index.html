	<p>Hello! My name is Jasmine Nguyen and I am a freshman studying Computer Science at SUNY University at Buffalo! Growing up, I always had a love for mathematics and languages so programming sparked my interest right away. Programming isn't always easy, but it's something that's amazing and it makes you feel so satisfied when you successfully finish coding something.</p>
