    <br></br>WHY LEARN MATH?</h3>
<p>I know what you're thinking-- that you'll never use math again once you're done with school. But that's simply not the case! Math is all around us.
<br></br>
  Math is important in life because it is used to perform many different daily tasks, such as telling time, reading an odometer, counting change and to make strategic decisions in one's work life. Similarly, nearly every profession uses some form of math. For example, nurses, engineers, bank tellers, pharmacists and stock market analysts use math every day to perform their professional duties well.
<br></br>
  Math is a life skill needed by everyone to make even simple choices in regard to insurance rates, investment options and looking at stock market trends and data. Or even at those times when out shopping and you want to calculate how much things will cost.
<br></br>
  Math is necessary even in sports and for playing board games like chess where one has to make strategic moves. In sports, some uses of math include knowing about statistics, probability and geometry. For example, in bowling, players need to figure out the best angle to throw a ball for a strike.
<br></br>
By learning math, it changes the way you think and prepares your mind for more intensive thinking in the future.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">WHAT IS BUNNY MATH?</h3>
    <p>Learning math isn't always easy. It takes time, determination, and lots of practice--that's where Bunny Math comes in! Bunny Math is a free and easy to use web based resource for students of all ages to learn math. On Bunny Math, there are a selection of math textbooks made available for students to learn new concepts and to study by doing practice problems. Every math subject is divded up into coherent chapters with a collection of exercises at the end of each chapter. A link to exercise solutions are also provided with each subject.</p>
   <br></br>
   <p>While the textbooks Bunny Math posts are commonly used by high schools and colleges, that does not mean that you should abuse the fact that there are solutions provided for every question. The solutions are tool provided to you so that you can check your work after finishing a problem. Remember, if you simply copy down someone else's work, you are only cheating yourself! Don't be afraid to refer to the solutions for help, but please use them in a way that helps you grow as a student.</p>

  <h3>TIPS FOR STUDYING MATH:</h3>
  <p>Mathematics is a subject that every student has to study at one time or another. Math is one of those subjects which you can easily spend hours studying but end up none the wiser. No matter how much you have studied, if you can not solve the problem on day of the test, you are lost. Thankfully, there are some techniques for studying maths that you can do regardless of your level.</p>
  <br>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">

  <li>Practice, Practice, PRACTICE!
  <ul><li>It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems.  The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. Each problem has its own characteristics and it’s important to have solved it in numerous ways before tackling the exam. There is no escaping this reality, to do well in a Maths exam you need to have solved a LOT of mathematical problems beforehand.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <br>

  <li>Review Errors
    <ul>
    <li>When you’re practising with these problems, it’s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. Understanding how you approached the problem and where you went wrong is a great way of becoming stronger and avoiding the same mistakes in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>Master Key Concepts
    <ul>
    <li>Do not try to memorise the processes. This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. This will help you understand how you should approach such problems in the future. Remember that Math is a sequential subject so it’s important to have a firm understanding of the key concepts that underpin a mathematical topic before moving on to work on other, more complex solutions which are based on understanding the basics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>Create a Distraction Free Environment
    <ul>
    <li>Mathematics is a subject that requires more concentration than any other. A proper study environment and a distraction free area could be the determining factor when solving complex equations or problems in geometry, algebra or trigonometry! Studying with music can help create a relaxing atmosphere and stimulate the flow of information. Having suitable background music can foster an environment of maximum concentration. Of course, you should steer clear of Pitbull and Eminem, instrumental music is the best thing in these times.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>Apply Math to Real World Problems
    <ul>
    <li>As much as possible, try to apply real-world problems when approaching maths. Math can be very abstract sometimes so looking for a practical application can help change your perspective and assimilate ideas differently. Probability, for example, can be used in everyday life to predict the outcome of something happening and determine whether you want to take a risk such as if you should buy a lottery ticket or gamble. Oh and don’t forget that it’s also important to have confidence in yourself and face the exam knowing that you have prepared properly!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
