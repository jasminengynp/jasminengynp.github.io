   <h1>Why Learn Math?</h1>
   <p>I know what you're thinking-- that you'll never use math again once you're done with school. But that's simply not the case! Math is all around us.
<br></br>
  Math is important in life because it is used to perform many different daily tasks, such as telling time, reading an odometer, counting change and to make strategic decisions in one's work life. Similarly, nearly every profession uses some form of math. For example, nurses, engineers, bank tellers, pharmacists and stock market analysts use math every day to perform their professional duties well.
<br></br>
  Math is a life skill needed by everyone to make even simple choices in regard to insurance rates, investment options and looking at stock market trends and data. Or even at those times when out shopping and you want to calculate how much things will cost.
<br></br>
  Math is necessary even in sports and for playing board games like chess where one has to make strategic moves. In sports, some uses of math include knowing about statistics, probability and geometry. For example, in bowling, players need to figure out the best angle to throw a ball for a strike.
<br></br>
By learning math, it changes the way you think and prepares your mind for more intensive thinking in the future.</p>
   <br></br>

   <h1>What is Bunny Math?</h1>
   <p>Learning math isn't always easy. It takes time, determination, and lots of practice--that's where Bunny Math comes in! Bunny Math is a free and easy to use web based resource for students of all ages to learn math. On Bunny Math, there are a selection of math textbooks made available for students to learn new concepts and to study by doing practice problems. Every math subject is divded up into coherent chapters with a collection of exercises at the end of each chapter. A link to exercise solutions are also provided with each subject.</p>
   <br></br>
   <p>While the textbooks Bunny Math posts are commonly used by high schools and colleges, that does not mean that you should abuse the fact that there are solutions provided for every question. The solutions are tool provided to you so that you can check your work after finishing a problem. Remember, if you simply copy down someone else's work, you are only cheating yourself! Don't be afraid to refer to the solutions for help, but please use them in a way that helps you grow as a student.</p>
   <br></br>
   <h1>Why "Bunny"?</h1>
   <p>To some, learning math is like learning a brand new language that is taught in a language that you aren't familiar with at all. Bunny Math encourages students to journey "down the rabbit hole" into what may be a disorientating world and to make that experience worth while. We all get lost along the way sometimes when learning math, but the only way to get better at math is to keep on doing it!</p>
